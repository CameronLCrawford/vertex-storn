# vertex-storn
This project is very similar to my previous [cpu-compiler](https://github.com/CameronLCrawford/cpu-compiler) project except it adds very basic OOP-type features. This added functionality is reflected both in a change of CPU design (the new CPU now being called the "Vertex" model) and in the language design (the new language being referred to as "Storn").
